abstract = {The Cenomanian–Turonian macrofauna from the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt offers an excellent opportunity to test the applicability of gradient analysis in palaeoecology and biostratigraphy. Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) is a simple multivariate technique for arranging species and samples along environmental gradients. In order to reconstruct palaeoecological patterns and biostratigraphy, 42 samples, 4564 individuals, and 132 species from three sections of eastern Sinai were subjected to DCA. Compared with other multivariate techniques such as cluster analysis, the macrobenthic associations (obtained by DCA) fall fully within or deviate only slightly from associations obtained by cluster analysis. However, DCA makes it possible to arrange these associations from completely random distribution (as tested by cluster analysis) to a temporal gradient. Therefore, it is possible to use this multivariate technique also as a useful tool in biostratigraphy. The first detrended correspondence axis (DC1) reflects a water-depth gradient from onshore to offshore, higher scores being typical of onshore samples from the southernmost section and lower scores being typical of offshore samples from the northern section. Overprinted on the DC1 axis is also a gradient of life and feeding modes, as samples with low scores are dominated by epifaunal species and samples with high scores display a higher proportion of shallow-infaunal taxa. With respect to the second detrended correspondence axis (DC2), substrate composition and water energy are overprinted on this axis as samples with low scores predominantly are coarse-grained carbonates (e.g., reefal rudstone), while samples with high scores primarily are mixed-siliciclastics/carbonates (e.g., marl), which are dominated by low-energy taxa. Because the substrate conditions are closely related to the water energy, the coarse-grained substrates were deposited under high water energy, while the marly facies was deposited under low-energy conditions. Excursions in DC2 scores, reflecting substrate composition and water energy, are used to reconstruct the macrobenthic associations; eight associations and two assemblages were recognized. High stress environments (low DC2 scores) were occupied by less diverse associations such as the Chondrodonta joannae association and the Pchelinsevia coquandiana–Praeradiolites biskraensis association. The latter association is stratigraphically followed by high-diversity associations such as the Ilymatogyra africana–Rhynchostreon suborbiculatum association, which preferred less-stressed environments (high DC2 scores).}
